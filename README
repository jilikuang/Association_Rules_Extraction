c) Description



d) How to run:

    python main.py <CSV filepath> <min_supp> <min_conf>
    where:
        * CSV filepath: the CSV file
        * min_supp: the minimum/threshold of support
        * min_conf: the minimum/threshold of confidence


e) Internal Design

    The program is composed of 3 parts: Data classification, A-priori algorithm, Display

        Data classification: Since most of data is numerical, we need to classify them into several classes so that
        we can have enough support for a specific class.

        A-priori algorithm: Compute the high frequent item_set

        Display: Display the results according to the requirement
