c) Description
    (a)
    The original version of the dataset we use is "DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Result" from NYC
    Open Data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59?).

    (b)
    In the original dataset, there are 498433 rows and 18 columns, which are CAMIS, DBA, BORO, BUILDING, STREET,
    ZIPCODE, PHONE, CUISINE DESCRIPTION, INSPECTION DATE, ACTION, VIOLATION CODE, VIOLATION DESCRIPTION, CRITICAL FLAG,
    SCORE, GRADE, GRADE DATE, RECORD DATE, INSPECTION TYPE. We delete the following columns 0 1 3 4 5 6 9 11 15 16.

    To make the data more applicable, we did the following steps:
        (1) Remove the row with empty column
        (2) Add the new column of inspection season according ot the exact inspection date
        (3) Add the new column of cuisine region according to the exact cuisine type for bigger category: Asian(A),
            European(E), North American(N), South American(S), Africa(AF), and Other(O). The restaurants are classified
            by the cuisine description following the mapping mentioned in part e).
        (4) Cap the score with 30

    We constructed csvporc.py to trim CSV file and add supplementary data in the CSV file. The usage of the python
    script is shown as follows:

        python csvproc.py <input CSV file> <trim|modify> <arguments for trim>
        where:
            * input CSV file: the CSV file to be processed
            * trim|modify: trim the target CSV file | add/modify the target CSV file
            * arguments for trim: the indexes of columns to be removed (could be left empty)

    The input CSV file to csvproc.py will not be modified, but an output.csv will be generated for the desired
    operation.

    (c) The reason why this INTEGRATED-DATASET is interesting is that ...


d) How to run:

    python main.py <CSV filepath> <min_supp> <min_conf>
    where:
        * CSV filepath: the CSV file
        * min_supp: the minimum/threshold of support
        * min_conf: the minimum/threshold of confidence


e) Internal Design

    The program is composed of 3 parts: Data classification, A-priori algorithm, Display

        Data classification: Since part of data is numerical, we need to classify them into several classes so that
        we can have enough support for a specific class. And it can produce more meaningful result.

        The classical version of a-priori algorithm is as follow:
        1. Compute the high frequent item sets
        2. Generate all possible association rules based on the frequent item sets
        3. Get all based on the min-support and min-confidence

        Display: Display the results according to the requirement in the instruction


f) Interesting Sample

    If we run the following command with min_sup = 0.2 and min_conf = 0.65,

    python main.py INTEGRATED-DATASET.csv 0.2 0.65

    The interesting point is that ...
